# Clearage documentation

Hi! This is a simple documentation on how to use this extension.


## Simple use

Click on icon or press Alt-L, It couldn't be **easier**!


## Console methods

We want to preserve your precious time by allowing you to clean your local storage as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

It is on this concept that the extension is intended to be as simple as possible to use.

We do not seek to complicate its use. But we want to make it possible to use methods developed for specific cases. 

We have chosen to integrate these methods through the web console to avoid missing our main principle: its speed and ease of use.
